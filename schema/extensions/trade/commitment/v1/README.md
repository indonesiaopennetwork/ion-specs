# trade/commitment/v1

Per-line item — resource, offer, quantity, locked price, customisation selections, special instructions.

## Attaches to
`beckn:Commitment.commitmentAttributes`

See `attributes.yaml` for complete field definitions.

## Network-required fields

The following fields are always required for this pack by ION network policy (`ion.yaml → x-ion-field-requirements.alwaysRequired`):

- `lineId`
- `resourceId`
- `offerId`
- `quantity`

Mandatoriness is enforced by ONIX — these fields are not marked `required:` in the schema itself (mandatoriness lives in network policy, not the schema).

## Per-step required fields

The `flows/trade/patterns/storefront/v1/pattern.yaml` lists every field ONIX validates at each API step for your commerce flow — use it as your implementation checklist. If ONIX rejects a message, check your step's `requiredFields` list in that file first.

## Used in

`flows/trade/README.md — used in all trade patterns`

## Common rejection reasons

Missing `lineId` → `ION-8xxx`. Missing `quantity` → `ION-3xxx`. See `errors/README.md` for the full error code reference.
